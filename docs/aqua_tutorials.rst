`Qiskit Aqua Tutorials <https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua-tutorials>`__ is a set of code examples,
`Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`__ and sample input files
that enable experimenting with :ref:`aqua-library`, :ref:`aqua-chemistry`, :ref:`aqua-ai`
and :ref:`aqua-optimization`.  The programs included in Aqua Tutorials demonstrate
how to use Aqua and its domain-specific applications programmatically, and also
how to extend Aqua with new components.  This feature is particularly useful to
quantum researchers who are interested in :ref:`aqua-extending` with new algorithmic
components.

The Aqua Tutorials `repository <https://github.com/Qiskit/aqua-tutorials>`__ is supposed to be
installed via the ``git clone`` command.  This will allow the user to place its code in a
convenient location in the file system, where it will be easier to browse the examples and
execute the Jupyter Notebooks provided by Aqua Tutorials.

A `Jupyter Notebook nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/aqua-tutorials/blob/master/index.ipynb>`__
allows for a quick and intuitive way to browse through the various Jupyter Notebooks offered by
Aqua Tutorials.
